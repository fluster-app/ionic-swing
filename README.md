# ionic-swing

ionic-swing is a fork of the following projects intended to add the swipeable cards capatibilies to Ionic (>= 2)

- swing.js (version 4.3.0, https://github.com/gajus/swing)
- angular2-swing (version 0.11.0, https://github.com/ksachdeva/angular2-swing)

The main reason behind this fork is that I was facing a problem with hammerjs, which was freezing the scrolling of my application on iOS and Android devices when I was using (swipe) on a list or on an ion-scroll.

After having unsuccessfully tried many solutions I was thinking, after all, that Ionic already include is own version of hammer.

Therefore I decided to create this fork with the goal to make a version of swing.js which doesn't embed any external hammerjs.

## Current status

This fork project is in version beta but seems to work (tested with Ionic 3.1.0).

Possible improvements not yet done:

- Improve typescripting and remove class swing.ts
- The fork special dependencies are, inherited from swing.js, raf, rebound, sister, vendor-prefix. To spare size of my application (smaller bundle = faster boot), it should be checked if these can't be replaced with native code or smaller libs.

## Installation

To install this library, run:

```bash
$ npm install ionic-swing --save
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the IonicSwingModule

In your app.module.ts, import the library like following:

and add it to your imports:

        ...
        IonicSwingModule
        ...
    ]

### 2. To implement a card stack
